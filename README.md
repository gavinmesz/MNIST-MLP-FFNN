# MNIST-MLP-FFNN
Feedforward multilayer perceptron neural network that trains on the MNIST dataset.

Gradient descent for minimizing cost function, categorical cross-entropy for cost function, softmax on the output layer.

.py file for the raw code which won't work without the training sets, .zip file for the code and training set, .pdf for the detailed report of the mathematics and the results.
